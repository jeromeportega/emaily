# Emaily
#### React/Redux, Express, Node, MongoDB, Stripe, SendGrid, Google OAuth

An application that I built as part of a full-stack MERN course I took through Udemy.

It allows the user to create a survey, emails it out to users to gather replies, and tracks their clicks in the email through SendGrid.
Emaily also takes payments through Stripe to send surveys out.

Please use the following fake credit card credentials to sample the credit card charging and get credits.
